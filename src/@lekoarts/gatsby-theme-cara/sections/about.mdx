## About

I'm Vicki. After living and teaching in rural Japan for
five years, I have returned stateside to switch careers and go into web
development. I am passionate about trying new things and sharing knowledge.
I am a quick learner, and my experiences moving and changing careers have
made me adaptable to many situations. 日本語をすこし話します。
