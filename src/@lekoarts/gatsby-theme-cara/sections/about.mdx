## About Me

I'm Vicki. After living and teaching in rural Japan for
five years, I have returned stateside to switch careers and go into web
development. I am passionate about trying new things and sharing knowledge.
I am a quick learner, and my experiences moving and changing careers have
made me adaptable to many situations. 日本語をすこし話します。

What I love most about Leonardo is his vast array of interests. Today he is
best known for his paintings, but his resume also included engineer, inventor,
stage designer, musician, anatomist, scientist and more.
